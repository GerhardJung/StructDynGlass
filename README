INPUT:

- The input for this program are N_S x N_i lammps-xyz files (example files, see folder "data")
-> N_S: number of different initial structures
-> N_i: number of different isoconfigurational trajactories per structures
-> It is assumed that the length and waiting times of all files are identical

DATA EVALUATION (isoconfigurational average):

- From the isoconfigurational trajectories the following evaluation steps can be performed:
-> Calculate the isoconfigurational average for various dynamical variables 
-> Calculate (time-dependent) predictabilities of the isoconfigurational ensemble for these dynamical variables
-> Print extended xyz files, including initial structures and isoconfigurational averages 


DATA EVALUATION (structure):

- Functions to calculate structural properties and create batches for machine learning
-> Read these extended xyz files 
-> Calculate various particle properties in the initial structure
-> Print extended xyz files with particle properties
-> Create batches for machine learning
